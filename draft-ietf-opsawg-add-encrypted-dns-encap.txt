             RADIUS Extensions for DHCP Configured Services
                 draft-ietf-opsawg-add-encrypted-dns-03

Abstract

   This document specifies two new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry any DHCP option.  Even if the
   specification was initially motivated by the configuration of
   encrypted DNS resolvers, the specification is generic and can be
   applicable to any service that relies upon DHCP.  Both DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6 configured services are covered.

1.  Introduction

   In the context of broadband services, Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs) usually provide DNS resolvers to their customers.  To that
   aim, ISPs deploy dedicated mechanisms (e.g., DHCP [RFC2132]
   [RFC8415], IPv6 Router Advertisement [RFC4861]) to advertise a list
   of DNS recursive servers to their customers.  Typically, the
   information used to populate DHCP messages and/or IPv6 Router
   Advertisements relies upon specific Remote Authentication Dial-In
   User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] attributes, such as the DNS-Server-
   IPv6-Address Attribute specified in [RFC6911].

Internet-Draft             RADIUS DHCP-Options              October 2022


   With the advent of encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)
   [RFC9250]), additional means are required to provision hosts with
   network-designated encrypted DNS.  To fill that void,
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] leverages existing protocols such as DHCP and IPv6
   Router Advertisement to provide hosts with the required information
   to connect to an encrypted DNS resolver.  However, there are no
   RADIUS attributes that can be used to populate the discovery messages
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  The same concern is likely to be
   encountered for future services that are configured using DHCP.

   This document specifies two new RADIUS attributes: DHCPv6-Options
   (Section 3.1) and DHCPv4-Options (Section 3.2) Attributes.  These
   attributes can include any DHCP option.  These two attributes are
   specified in order to accommodate both IPv4 and IPv6 deployment
   contexts while taking into account the constraints in Section 3.4 of
   [RFC6158].

   The mechanism specified in this document is a generic mechanism and
   might be employed in network scenarios where the DHCPv6 server and
   the RADIUS client are located in the same device.  The new attributes
   can also be used in deployments that rely upon the mechanisms defined
   in [RFC4014] or [RFC7037], which allows a DHCP relay agent that is
   collocated with a RADIUS client to pass attributes obtained from a
   RADIUS server to a DHCP server.

   This document adheres to [RFC8044] for defining the new attributes.

   A sample deployment usage of the DHCPv6-Options and DHCPv4-Options
   RADIUS Attributes is described in Section 4.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC2865], [RFC8415],
   and [RFC8499].  The following additional terms are used:

   DHCP:  refers to both DHCPv4 [RFC2132] and DHCPv6 [RFC8415].

   Encrypted DNS:  refers to a scheme where DNS exchanges are
      transported over an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS
      are DoT, DoH, and DoQ.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS DHCP-Options              October 2022


   Encrypted DNS resolver:  refers to a resolver (Section 6 of
      [RFC8499]) that supports encrypted DNS.

   DHCP*-Options:  refers to DHCPv4-Options and DHCPv6-Options RADIUS
      Attributes (Section 3).

3.  DHCP Options RADIUS Attributes

   This section specifies two new RADIUS Attributes for RADIUS clients
   and servers to exchange DHCP-encoded data.  This data is then used to
   feed the DHCP procedure between a DHCP client and a DHCP server.

   Both DHCPv4-Options and DHCPv6-Options RADIUS Attributes use the
   "Long Extended Type" format (Section 2.2 of [RFC6929]).  The
   description of the fields is provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

   These attributes use the "Long Extended Type" format in order to
   permit the transport of attributes encapsulating more than 253 octets
   of data.  DHCP options that can be included in the DHCP*-Options
   RADIUS Attributes are limited by the maximum packet size of 4096
   bytes.  In order to accommodate deployments with large options,
   implementations are RECOMMENDED to support a maximum packet size up
   to 65535 bytes.

   The value fields of DHCPv4-Options and DHCPv6-Options RADIUS
   Attributes are encoded in clear and not encrypted as, for example,
   Tunnel-Password Attribute [RFC2868].

   RADIUS implementations may support a configuration parameter to
   control the DHCP options that can be included in a DHCP*-Options
   RADIUS attribute.

   For ease of administrator configuration, the RADIUS server SHOULD
   expose the DHCP options and allow administrators to configure them,
   instead of requiring them to be entered as opaque data.

   These attributes are defined with globally unique names.  The naming
   of the attributes follows the guidelines in Section 2.7.1 of
   [RFC6929].

3.1.  DHCPv6-Options Attribute

   This attribute is of type "string" as defined in Section 3.5 of
   [RFC8044].

   The DHCPv6-Options Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However, the
   server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The DHCPv6-Options Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The DHCPv6-Options Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The DHCPv6-Options Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The DHCPv6-Options Attribute is structured as follows:

   Type

      245

   Length

      This field indicates the total length, in octets, of all fields of
      this attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      entire length of the embedded TLVs.

   Extended-Type

      TBA1 (see Section 7.1).

   Value

      This field contains a list of DHCPv6 options.  Multiple instances
      of the same DHCPv6 option MAY be included.  Consistent with
      Section 17 of [RFC7227], this document does not impose any option
      order when multiple options are present.

   The DHCPv6-Options Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 245.TBA1.

3.2.  DHCPv4-Options Attribute

   This attribute is of type "string" as defined in Section 3.5 of
   [RFC8044].

   The DHCPv4-Options Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However, the
   server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The DHCPv4-Options Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The DHCPv4-Options Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The DHCPv4-Options Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The DHCPv4-Options Attribute is structured as follows:

   Type

      245

   Length

      This field indicates the total length, in octets, of all fields of
      this attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      entire length of the embedded TLVs.

   Extended-Type

      TBA1 (see Section 7.1).

   Value

      This field contains a list of DHCPv4 options.

   The DHCPv4-Options Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 245.TBA2.

4.  Applicability to Encrypted DNS Provisioning

   Typical deployment scenarios are similar to those described, for
   instance, in Section 2 of [RFC6911].  For illustration purposes,
   Figure 1 shows an example where a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
   is provided with an encrypted DNS resolver.  This example assumes
   that the NAS embeds both RADIUS client and DHCPv6 server
   capabilities.

                   DHCPv6                     RADIUS

         Figure 1: An Example of RADIUS IPv6 Encrypted DNS Exchange

   Upon receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message from a CPE, the NAS sends
   a RADIUS Access-Request message to the Authentication, Authorization,
   and Accounting (AAA) server.  Once the AAA server receives the
   request, it replies with an Access-Accept message (possibly after
   having sent a RADIUS Access-Challenge message and assuming the CPE is
   entitled to connect to the network) that carries a list of parameters
   to be used for this session, and which include the encrypted DNS
   information.  Such an information is encoded as OPTION_V6_DNR
   instances ([I-D.ietf-add-dnr]) in the DHCPv6-Options RADIUS
   Attribute.  These instances are then used by the NAS to complete the
   DHCPv6 procedure that the CPE initiated to retrieve information about
   the encrypted DNS service to use.  The Discovery of Network-
   designated Resolvers (DNR) procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] is
   then followed between the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server.

   Should any encrypted DNS-related information (e.g., Authentication
   Domain Name (ADN), IPv6 address) change, the RADIUS server sends a
   RADIUS Change-of-Authorization (CoA) message [RFC5176] that carries
   the RADIUS DHCPv6 Attribute with the updated OPTION_V6_DNR
   information to the NAS.  Once that message is received and validated
   by the NAS, it replies with a RADIUS CoA ACK message.  The Network
   Access Server (NAS) replaces the old encrypted DNS resolver
   information with the new one and sends a DHCPv6 Reconfigure message
   which leads the DHCPv6 client to initiate a Renew/Reply message
   exchange with the DHCPv6 server.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS DHCP-Options              October 2022


   In deployments where the NAS behaves as a DHCPv6 relay agent, the
   procedure discussed in Section 3 of [RFC7037] can be followed.  To
   that aim, Section 7.2 updates the "RADIUS Attributes Permitted in
   DHCPv6 RADIUS Option" registry ([DHCP-RADIUS]).

   Figure 2 shows another example where a CPE is provided with an
   encrypted DNS resolver, but the CPE uses DHCPv4 to retrieve its
   encrypted DNS resolver.

   Other deployment scenarios can be envisaged, such as returning
   customized service parameters (e.g., different DoH URI Templates) as
   a function of the service/policies/preferences that are set by a
   network administrator.  How an administrator indicates its
   service/policies/preferences to an AAA server is out of scope.

5.  Security Considerations

   RADIUS-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC2865].

   This document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in
   place between the RADIUS client and server with communication
   optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC6614].

   Security considerations specific to the DHCP options that are carried
   in RADIUS are discussed in relevant documents that specify these
   options.  For example, security considerations (including traffic
   theft) are discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

6.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain these attributes, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access-  Challenge Acct.    #        Attribute
   Request Accept  Reject             Request
    0+      0+      0        0         0+      245.TBA1 DHCPv6-Options
    0+      0+      0        0         0+      245.TBA2 DHCPv4-Options

   CoA-Request CoA-ACK CoA-NACK #        Attribute
     0+          0       0      245.TBA1 DHCPv6-Options
     0+          0       0      245.TBA2 DHCPv4-Options

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries:

   0  This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+ Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New RADIUS Attributes

   IANA is requested to assign two new RADIUS attribute types from the
   IANA registry "Radius Attribute Types" [RADIUS-Types]:
