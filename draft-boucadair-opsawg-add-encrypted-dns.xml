    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the context of broadband services, Internet Service Providers
      (ISPs) usually provide DNS resolvers to their customers. To that aim,
      ISPs deploy dedicated mechanisms (e.g., DHCP <xref
      target="RFC2132"></xref> <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>, IPv6 Router
      Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>) to advertise a list of DNS
      recursive servers to their customers. Typically, the information used to
      populate DHCP messages and/or IPv6 Router Advertisements relies upon
      specific Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) <xref
      target="RFC2865"></xref> attributes, such as the DNS-Server-IPv6-Address
      Attribute specified in <xref target="RFC6911"></xref>.</t>

      <t>With the advent of encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref>, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref>, or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) <xref
      target="RFC9250"></xref>), additional means are required to provision
      hosts with network-designated encrypted DNS. To fill that void, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> leverages existing protocols such as
      DHCP and IPv6 Router Advertisement to provide hosts with the required
      information to connect to an encrypted DNS resolver. However, there are
      no RADIUS attributes that can be used to populate the discovery messages
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document specifies two new RADIUS attributes: IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
      (<xref target="v6"></xref>) and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS (<xref
      target="v4"></xref>) Attributes. These two attributes are specified in
      order to accommodate both IPv4 and IPv6 deployment contexts while taking
      into account the constraints in Section 3.4 of <xref
      target="RFC6158"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Typical deployment scenarios are similar to those described, for
      instance, in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC6911"></xref>. Some of these
      deployments may rely upon the mechanisms defined in <xref
      target="RFC4014"></xref> or <xref target="RFC7037"></xref>, which allows
      a Network Access Server (NAS) to pass attributes obtained from a RADIUS
      server to a DHCP server. For illustration purposes, <xref
      target="ex"></xref> shows an example where a Customer Premises Equipment
      (CPE) is provided with an encrypted DNS resolver. This example assumes
      that the NAS embeds both RADIUS client and DHCPv6 server
      capabilities.</t>

        </figure></t>

      <t>Upon receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message from a CPE, the NAS sends
      a RADIUS Access-Request message to the Authentication, Authorization,
      and Accounting (AAA) server. Once the AAA server receives the request,
      it replies with an Access-Accept message (possibly after having sent a
      RADIUS Access-Challenge message and assuming the CPE is entitled to
      connect to the network) that carries a list of parameters to be used for
      this session, and which include the encrypted DNS information. The
      content of the IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is then used by the NAS to
      complete the DHCPv6 procedure that the CPE initiated to retrieve
      information about the encrypted DNS service to use. The Discovery of
      Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) procedure defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> is then followed between the DHCPv6
      client and the DHCPv6 server.</t>

      <t>Should any encrypted DNS-related information (e.g., Authentication
      Domain Name (ADN), IPv6 address) change, the RADIUS server sends a
      RADIUS Change-of-Authorization (CoA) message <xref
      target="RFC5176"></xref> that carries the RADIUS IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
      Attributes to the NAS. Once that message is received and validated by
      the NAS, it replies with a RADIUS CoA ACK message. The NAS replaces the
      old encrypted DNS resolver information with the new one and sends a
      DHCPv6 Reconfigure message which leads the DHCPv6 client to initiate a
      Renew/Reply message exchange with the DHCPv6 server.</t>

      <t>In deployments where the NAS behaves as a DHCPv6 relay agent, the
      procedure discussed in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC7037"></xref> can
      be followed. To that aim, <xref target="urd"></xref> updates the
      registry of RADIUS Attributes permitted in the DHCPv6 RADIUS Option
      (<xref target="DHCP-RADIUS"></xref>).</t>

      <t><xref target="ex2"></xref> shows another example where a CPE is
      provided with an encrypted DNS resolver, but the CPE uses DHCPv4 to
      retrieve its encrypted DNS resolver.</t>
