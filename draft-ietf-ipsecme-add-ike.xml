    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to assign encrypted DNS
      configurations to an Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
      <xref target="RFC7296"></xref> initiator. Specifically, it assigns one
      or more Authentication Domain Names (ADNs) of DNS resolvers that support
      encrypted DNS protocols. The specific protocols supported are described
      using the Service Parameters format defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>; supported protocols include
      DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>, DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
      <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>, and DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) <xref
      target="RFC9250"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document introduces three new IKEv2 Configuration Payload
      Attribute Types (<xref target="RI"></xref>) to add support for encrypted
      DNS resolvers. The ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6 attribute types (<xref
      target="RIIP"></xref>) are used to provision ADNs, a list of IP
      addresses, and a set of service parameters. The ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
      attribute (<xref target="digest"></xref>) additionally allows a specific
      resolver certificate to be indicated by the IKEv2 responder.</t>

      <t>Sample use cases are described in <xref target="depl"></xref>. The
      Configuration Payload Attribute Types defined in this document are not
      specific to these deployments, but can also be used in other deployment
      contexts. It is out of the scope of this document to provide a
      comprehensive list of deployment contexts.</t>

      <t>The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by a VPN provider can get a
      domain-validate certificate from a public Certificate Authority (CA).
      The VPN client does not need to be provisioned with the root certificate
      of a private CA to authenticate the certificate of the encrypted DNS
      resolvers. The encrypted DNS resolver can run on private IP addresses
      and its access can be restricted to clients connected to the VPN.</t>

      <t>Note that, for many years, typical designs have often considered that
      the DNS resolver was usually located inside the protected domain, but
      could be located outside of it. With encrypted DNS, the latter option
      becomes plausible.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>R (Reserved, 1 bit) - This bit MUST be set to zero and MUST be
            ignored on receipt (see <xref section="3.15.1"
            target="RFC7296"></xref> for details).</t>

            ENCDNS_IP6, as registered in <xref target="IANA1"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Length (2 octets, unsigned integer) - Length of the data in
            octets. In particular, this field is set to:<list style="symbols">
                <t>0 if the Configuration payload has types CFG_REQUEST (if no
                specific DNS resolver is requested) or CFG_ACK. If the
                'Length' field is set to 0, then later fields shown in <xref

            <t>Service Priority (2 octets) - The priority of this attribute
            compared to other ENCDNS_IP* instances. This 16-bit unsigned
            integer is interpreted following the rules specified in <xref
            section="2.4.1" target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />AliasMode (<xref section="2.4.2"
            target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>) is not supported
            because such a mode will trigger additional Do53 queries while the
            data can be supplied directly in the IKE response. As such, this
            field MUST NOT be set to 0.</t>

            <t>Num Addresses (1 octet) - Indicates the number of enclosed IPv4
            (for ENCDNS_IP4) or IPv6 (for ENCDNS_IP6) addresses. This value
            MUST NOT be set to 0 if the Configuration payload is of type
            CFG_REPLY or CFG_SET.</t>

            <t>ADN Length (1 octet) - Indicates the length of the
            "Authentication Domain Name" field in octets.</t>

            <t>IP Address(es) (variable) - Includes one or more IP addresses
            that can be used to reach the encrypted DNS resolver identified by
            the Authentication Domain Name. For ENCDNS_IP4 this field contains
            one or more 4-octet IPv4 addresses, and for ENCDNS_IP6 this field
            contains one or more 16-octet IPv6 addresses.</t>

            <t>Authentication Domain Name (variable) - A fully qualified
            domain name of the encrypted DNS resolver following the syntax
            defined in <xref target="RFC5890"></xref>. The name MUST NOT
            contain any terminators (e.g., NULL, CR). <vspace

            "doh1.example.com".</t>

            <t>Service Parameters (SvcParams) (variable) - Specifies a set of
            service parameters that are encoded following the rules in <xref
            section="2.1" target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>. Section

            MUST NOT include "ipv4hint" or "ipv6hint" SvcParams as they are
            superseded by the included IP addresses. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If no port service parameter is included, this
            indicates that default port numbers should be used. As a reminder,
            the default port number is 853 for DoT, 443 for DoH, and 853 for
            DoQ. <vspace blankLines="1" />The service parameters apply to all

        ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO MUST be returned with zero-length data.</t>

        <t>As discussed in <xref section="3.15.1" target="RFC7296"></xref>,

    <section anchor="protocol" title="IKEv2 Protocol Exchange">
      <t>This section describes how the attributes defined in <xref
      target="RI"></xref> are used to configure an IKEv2 initiator with one or
      more encrypted DNS resolvers.</t>

      <t>Initiators first indicate support for encrypted DNS by including
      ENCDNS_IP* attributes in their CFG_REQUEST payloads. Responders supply
      encrypted DNS configuration by including ENCDNS_IP* attributes in their
      CFG_REPLY payloads. Concretely:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes either or
          both of the ENCDNS_IP4 and ENCDNS_IP6 attributes in its CFG_REQUEST.
          If the initiator does not want to request specific DNS resolvers, it
          sets the Length field to 0 for the attribute. For a given attribute
          type, the initiator MAY send either an empty attribute or a list of
          distinct suggested resolvers. The initiator MAY also include the
          ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute with a list of hash algorithms that are
          supported by the encrypted DNS client.</t>

          <t>If the request includes multiple bitwise identical attributes,
          only the first occurrence is processed, and the rest SHOULD be
          ignored by the responder. The responder MAY discard the full request
          if the count of repeated attributes exceeds an (implementation
          specific) threshold.</t>

          <t>For each ENCDNS_IP* attribute from the CFG_REQUEST, if the
          responder supports the corresponding address family, and absent any
          policy restrictions, the responder sends back ENCDNS_IP*
          attribute(s) in the CFG_REPLY with an appropriate list of IP
          addresses, service parameters, and an ADN. The list of IP addresses
          MUST include at least one IP address. The service parameters MUST
          include at least the "alpn" service parameter. The responder MAY
          ignore suggested values from the initiator (if any). Multiple
          instances of the same ENCDNS_IP* attribute MAY be returned if
          distinct ADNs or service parameters need to be assigned to the
          initiator. In such instances, the different attributes can have
          matching or distinct IP addresses. These instances MUST be presented
          to a local DNS client following their service priority (i.e.,
          smaller service priority values indicates a higher preference).</t>

          <t>In addition, the responder MAY return the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
          attribute to convey a digest of the certificate of the encrypted DNS
          and the identifier of the hash algorithm that is used to generate
          the digest.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST includes an ENCDNS_IP* attribute but the
          CFG_REPLY does not include an ENCDNS_IP* matching the requested
          address family, this is an indication that requested address family
          is not supported by the responder or the responder is not configured
          to provide corresponding resolver addresses.</t>

          <t>If the initiator receives both ENCDNS_IP* and INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes, it is RECOMMENDED that the
          initiator uses the encrypted DNS resolvers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DNS client establishes an encrypted DNS session (e.g., DoT, DoH,
      DoQ) with the address(es) conveyed in ENCDNS_IP* and uses the mechanism
      discussed in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> to authenticate
      the DNS resolver certificate using the authentication domain name
      conveyed in ENCDNS_IP*.</t>

      <t>If the CFG_REPLY includes an ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute, the client
      has to create an SPKI hash of the DNS resolver certificate received in
      the TLS handshake using the negotiated hash algorithm in the
      ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute. If the computed digest for an ADN matches
      the one sent in the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute, the encrypted DNS
      resolver certificate is successfully validated. If so, the client
      continues with the TLS connection as normal. Otherwise, the client MUST
      treat the resolver certificate validation failure as a non-recoverable
      error. This approach is similar to certificate usage PKIX-EE(1) with
      selector SPKI(1) defined in <xref target="RFC7671"></xref> but without
      PKIX validation.</t>

      <t>If the IPsec connection is a split-tunnel configuration and the
      initiator negotiated INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN as per <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref>, the DNS client resolves the internal names
      using ENCDNS_IP* DNS resolvers.</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Note: <xref target="RFC8598"></xref> requires INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attribute to be mandatory present when
          INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN is included. This specification relaxes that
          constraint in the presence of ENCDNS_IP* attributes. That is, if
          ENCDNS_IP* attributes are supplied, it is allowed to include
          INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN even in the absence of INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or
          INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document adheres to the security considerations defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, this document does not alter
      the trust on the DNS configuration provided by a responder.</t>

      <t>Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in <xref
      section="3.2" target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>. Hosting
      encrypted DNS resolvers even in case of split-VPN configuration
      minimizes the attack vector (e.g., a compromised network device cannot
      monitor/modify DNS traffic). This specification describes a mechanism to
      restrict access to the DNS messages to only the parties that need to
      know.</t>

      <t>The initiator may trust the encrypted DNS resolvers supplied by means
      of IKEv2 from a trusted responder more than the locally provided DNS
      resolvers, especially in the case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
      networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks).</t>

      <t>If the IKEv2 responder has used NULL Authentication method <xref
      target="RFC7619"></xref> to authenticate itself, the initiator MUST NOT
      use returned ENCDNS_IP* resolvers configuration unless it is
      pre-configured, e.g., in the operating system or the application.</t>

      <t>This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
      trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in <xref section="6"
      target="RFC8598"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC9076"></xref>, the use of encrypted
      DNS does not reduce the data available in the DNS resolver. For example,
      the reader may refer to <xref section="8" target="RFC8484"></xref> or
      <xref section="7" target="RFC9250"></xref> for a discussion on specific
      privacy considerations to encrypted DNS.</t>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Deployment Scenarios">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Roaming Enterprise Users">
        <t>In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of <xref
        target="RFC7296"></xref>), a roaming user connects to the Enterprise
        network through an IPsec tunnel. The split-tunnel Virtual Private
        Network (VPN) configuration allows the endpoint to access hosts that
        reside in the Enterprise network <xref target="RFC8598"></xref> using
        that tunnel; other traffic not destined to the Enterprise does not
        traverse the tunnel. In contrast, a non-split-tunnel VPN configuration
        causes all traffic to traverse the tunnel into the Enterprise.</t>

        <t>For both split- and non-split-tunnel configurations, the use of
        encrypted DNS instead of Do53 provides privacy and integrity
        protection along the entire path (rather than just to the VPN
        termination device) and can communicate the encrypted DNS resolver
        policies.</t>

        <t>For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS resolver to resolve internal-only
        domain names.</t>

        <t>For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided encrypted DNS resolver to resolve both internal
        and external domain names.</t>

        <t>Enterprise networks are susceptible to internal and external
        attacks. To minimize that risk all enterprise traffic is encrypted
        (Section 2.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="VPN Service Provider">
        <t>Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
        confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
        encrypted tunnel. A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
        about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
        phishing domains.</t>

        <t>Browsers and operating systems support DoH/DoT; VPN providers may
        no longer expect DNS clients to fall back to Do53 just because it is a
        closed network.</t>

        <t>The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by the VPN service provider can
        be securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 attributes
        specified in <xref target="RIIP"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNS Offload">
        <t>VPN service providers typically allow split-tunnel VPN
        configuration in which users can choose applications that can be
        excluded from the tunnel. For example, users may exclude applications
        that restrict VPN access.</t>

        <t>The encrypted DNS resolver hosted by the VPN service provider can
        be securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 attributes
        specified in <xref target="RIIP"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Examples">
      <t>The following depicts an example of a CFG_REQUEST to request the
      configuration of IPv6 DNS resolvers without providing any suggested
      values. In this example, the initiator uses the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO
      attribute to indicate that the encrypted DNS client supports SHA2-256
      (2), SHA2-384 (3), and SHA2-512 (4) hash algorithms. The label of these
      algoirthms is taken from <xref target="IANA-IKE-HASH"></xref>. The use
      of INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS is explained in <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>;
      it is thus not reiterated here.</t>
