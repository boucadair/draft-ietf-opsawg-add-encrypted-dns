1.  Introduction

   In the context of broadband services, Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs) usually provide DNS resolvers to their customers.  To that
   aim, ISPs deploy dedicated mechanisms to advertise a list of DNS
   Recursive DNS server(s) to their customers (e.g., DHCP [RFC2132]
   [RFC8415], IPv6 Router Advertisement [RFC4861]).  Typically, the
   information used to populate DHCP messages and/or IPv6 Router
   Advertisements relies upon specific Remote Authentication Dial-In
   User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] attributes, such as the DNS-Server-
   IPv6-Address Attribute specified in [RFC6911].

   With the advent of Encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)
   [RFC9250]), additional means are required to provision hosts with
   network-designated Encrypted DNS.  To fill that void,
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] leverages existing protocols such as DHCP and IPv6
   Router Advertisement to provide hosts with the required information
   to connect to an encrypted DNS resolver.  However, there are no
   RADIUS attributes that can be used to populate the discovery messages
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

Internet-Draft          RADIUS for Encrypted DNS          September 2022


   This document specifies two new RADIUS attributes: IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
   (Section 3.1) and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS (Section 3.2) Attributes.  These
   two attributes are specified in order to accommodate both IPv4 and
   IPv6 deployment contexts while taking into account the constraints in
   Section 3.4 of [RFC6158].

   Typical deployment scenarios are similar to those described, for
   instance, in Section 2 of [RFC6911].  Some of these deployments may
   rely upon the mechanisms defined in [RFC4014] or [RFC7037], which
   allows a Network Access Server (NAS) to pass attributes obtained from
   a RADIUS server to a DHCP server.  For illustration purposes,
   Figure 1 shows an example where a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
   is provided with an encrypted DNS resolver.  This example assumes
   that the NAS embeds both RADIUS client and DHCPv6 server
   capabilities.

   +-------------+           +-------------+             +-------+

         Figure 1: An Example of RADIUS IPv6 Encrypted DNS Exchange

   Upon receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message from a CPE, the NAS sends
   a RADIUS Access-Request message to the Authentication, Authorization,
   and Accounting (AAA) server.  Once the AAA server receives the
   request, it replies with an Access-Accept message (possibly after
   having sent a RADIUS Access-Challenge message and assuming the CPE is
   entitled to connect to the network) that carries a list of parameters
   to be used for this session, and which include the Encrypted DNS
   information.  The content of the IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is then
   used by the NAS to complete the DHCPv6 procedure that the CPE

   initiated to retrieve information about the encrypted DNS service to
   use.  The Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) procedure
   defined in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] is then followed between the DHCPv6
   client and the DHCPv6 server.

   Upon change of the any Encrypted DNS-related information (e.g., ADN,
   IPv6 address), the RADIUS server sends a RADIUS CoA message [RFC5176]
   that carries the RADIUS IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attributes to the NAS.
   Once that message is accepted by the NAS, it replies with a RADIUS
   CoA ACK message.  The NAS replaces the old encrypted DNS resolver
   information with the new one and sends a DHCPv6 Reconfigure message
   to cause the DHCPv6 client to initiate a Renew/Reply message exchange
   with the DHCPv6 server.

   Figure 2 shows another example where a CPE is provided with an
   encrypted DNS resolver, but the CPE uses DHCPv4 to retrieve its
   encrypted DNS resolver.

   Other deployment scenarios can be envisaged, such as returning
   customized service parameters (e.g., different DoH URI Templates) as
   a function of the service/policies/preferences that are set by a
   network administrator.  How an administrator indicates its
   service/policies/preferences to an AAA server is out of scope.

Internet-Draft          RADIUS for Encrypted DNS          September 2022


   This document adheres to [RFC8044] for defining the new attributes.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The
   following additional terms are used:

   DHCP:  refers to both DHCPv4 [RFC2132] and DHCPv6 [RFC8415].

   Encrypted DNS:  refers to a scheme where DNS exchanges are
      transported over an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS
      are DoT, DoH, and DoQ.

   *-Encrypted-DNS:  refers to IPv6-Encrypted-DNS and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS
      Attributes.

   Encrypted-DNS-*:  refers to any of the following attributes:
      Encrypted-DNS-ADN, Encrypted-DNS-IPv6-Address, Encrypted-DNS-
      IPv4-Address, Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams, and Encrypted-DNS-
      SvcPriority.

3.  Encrypted DNS RADIUS Attributes

   Both IPv6-Encrypted-DNS and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS have the same format
   shown in Figure 3.  The description of the fields is provided in
   Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

   These attributes and their embedded TLVs (Section 3.3) are defined
   with globally unique names.  The definition of the attributes follows
   the guidelines in Section 2.7.1 of [RFC6929].

   The value fields of *-Encrypted-DNS and Encrypted-DNS-* Attributes
   are encoded in clear and not encrypted as, for example, Tunnel-
   Password Attribute [RFC2868].

3.1.  IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute

   This attribute is of type "tlv" as defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC6929].

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute includes the authentication domain
   name, a list of IPv6 addresses, and a set of service parameters of an
   encrypted DNS resolver (Section 3.1.9 of [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]).

   Because multiple IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attributes may be provisioned to
   a requesting host, multiple instances of the IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
   attribute MAY be included; each instance of the attribute carries a
   distinct encrypted DNS resolver.  These TLVs SHOULD be processed
   following their service priority (i.e., smaller service priority
   indicates a higher preference).

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However, the
   server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is structured as follows:

   Type

      241

   Length

      This field indicates the total length, in octets, of all fields of
      this attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      entire length of the embedded TLVs.

   Extended-Type

      TBA1 (see Section 6.1).

   Value

      This field contains a set of TLVs as follows:

      Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV:  The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST
         include exactly one instance of Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV
         (Section 3.3.1).

      Encrypted-DNS-IPv6-Address TLV:  The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute
         SHOULD include one or multiple instances of Encrypted-DNS-
         IPv6-Address TLV (Section 3.3.2).  If multiple instances are
         included, they are ordered in the preference for use.  In
         contexts where putting additional complexity on requesting
         hosts is acceptable, returning an ADN only (that is, no
         Encrypted-DNS-IPv6-Address TLV is returned) can be considered.

      Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams TLV:  The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute
         SHOULD include one instance of Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams TLV
         (Section 3.3.4).

      Encrypted-DNS-SvcPriority TLV:  The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute
         SHOULD include one instance of Encrypted-DNS-SvcPriority TLV
         (Section 3.3.5).

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 241.TBA1.

3.2.  IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute

   This attribute is of type "tlv" as defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC6929].

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute includes the authentication domain
   name, a list of IPv4 addresses, and a set of service parameters of an
   encrypted DNS resolver (Section 3.1.9 of [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]).

   Because multiple IPv4-Encrypted-DNS attributes may be provisioned to
   a requesting host, multiple instances of the IPv4-Encrypted-DNS
   attribute MAY be included; each instance of the attribute carries a
   distinct encrypted DNS resolver.  These TLVs SHOULD be processed
   following their service priority (i.e., smaller service priority
   indicates a higher preference).

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However, the
   server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is structured as follows:

   Type

      241

   Length

      This field indicates the total length, in octets, of all fields of
      this attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      entire length of the embedded TLVs.

   Extended-Type

      TBA2 (see Section 6.1).

   Value

      This field contains a set of TLVs as follows:

      Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV:  The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST
         include exactly one instance of Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV
         (Section 3.3.1).

      Encrypted-DNS-IPv4-Address TLV:  The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute
         SHOULD include one or multiple instances of Encrypted-DNS-
         IPv4-Address TLV (Section 3.3.3).  In contexts where putting
         additional complexity on requesting hosts is acceptable,
         returning an ADN only (that is, no Encrypted-DNS-IPv4-Address
         TLV is returned) can be considered.

      Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams TLV:  The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute
         SHOULD include one instance of Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams TLV
         (Section 3.3.4).

      Encrypted-DNS-SvcPriority TLV:  The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute
         SHOULD include one instance of Encrypted-DNS-SvcPriority TLV
         (Section 3.3.5).

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 241.TBA2.

3.3.  RADIUS TLVs for Encrypted DNS

   The TLVs defined in the following subsections use the format defined
   in [RFC6929].

   These TLVs have the same name and number when encapsulated in any of
   the parent attributes defined in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

   The encoding of the "Value" field of these TLVs follows the
   recommendation of [RFC6158].

3.3.1.  Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV

4.  Security Considerations

   RADIUS-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC2865].

   This document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in
   place between the RADIUS client and server with communication
   optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC6614].

   Security considerations (including traffic theft) are discussed in
   Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

5.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain these attributes, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access-  Challenge Acct. # Attribute
   Request Accept  Reject             Request
    0+      0+      0        0         0+      TBA1 IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
    0+      0+      0        0         0+      TBA2 IPv4-Encrypted-DNS

   CoA-Request CoA-ACK CoA-NACK #   Attribute
     0+          0       0      TBA1 IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
     0+          0       0      TBA2 IPv4-Encrypted-DNS

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries:

   0  This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+ Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New RADIUS Attributes

   IANA is requested to assign two new RADIUS attribute types from the
   IANA registry "Radius Attribute Types" Section 6:

      241.TBA2  IPv4-Encrypted-DNS   tlv         This-Document

6.2.  New RADIUS TLVs

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry called "RADIUS
   Encrypted DNS TLVs" under the "Radius Attribute Types" registry
   [RADIUS-Types].

   The registration procedure for this subregistry is "Standards Action"
   as defined in (Section 4.9 of [RFC8126]).

   The subregistry is initially populated as follows:

   Value    Description                  Data Type    Reference
   -----    -------------------------    ---------    -------------
     0      Reserved

   TBA4     Encrypted-DNS-IPv6-Address   ipv6addr     Section 3.3.2
   TBA5     Encrypted-DNS-IPv4-Address   ipv4addr     Section 3.3.3
   TBA6     Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams      string       Section 3.3.4
   TBA7     Encrypted-DNS-SvcPriority    integer      Section 3.3.5
   6-255    Unassigned
